This directory contains the basic setup for running Scenic scenarios in CARLA  to create and store images for scenes based on scene graphs.

- `run_scenic.py`: This script executes the scenic scenarios and captures data.
- `*.scenic`: These files define the specific scenarios (e.g., `obstacle_clear.scenic`, `obstacle_rain.scenic`, etc.).
